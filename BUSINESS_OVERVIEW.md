# Business Overview: AI Coaching Platform

## The Problem

### Personal Development is Expensive and Inaccessible

Professional coaching and mentorship have proven to be transformative for personal and professional growth, yet they remain out of reach for most people:

- **Cost Barrier**: Traditional coaching costs $100-500 per hour, making it accessible only to executives and high-income professionals
- **Limited Availability**: Finding the right coach with relevant expertise and availability is time-consuming and often impossible in certain geographic areas
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Coaching outcomes vary dramatically based on the coach's experience, approach, and personality fit
- **Scalability Issues**: Human coaches can only serve a limited number of clients, creating supply constraints
- **Lack of Specialization**: Most people need multiple types of guidance (career, health, relationships, creativity) but can't afford multiple coaches

### Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Generic AI Chatbots**: Lack personality, context, and specialized coaching methodologies
- **Self-Help Apps**: Provide static content without personalized guidance or accountability
- **Online Courses**: One-way content delivery without interactive coaching or real-time feedback
- **Therapy Apps**: Focus on clinical mental health, not broader life coaching and skill development

**The core insight**: People don't just need information—they need personalized guidance, accountability, and a trusted relationship with someone who understands their unique context and goals.
